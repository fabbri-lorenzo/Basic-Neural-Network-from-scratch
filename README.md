# Basic-Neural-Network-from-scratch
Here you can find all the resources and the code needed to build a trivial neural network in Python using only numpy. The neural network is at its most basic level as optimisation is not implemented.

## Getting Started
In main.py you include the file nn_classes so that you import all the classes and functions needed to build the neurons structure and to feed it with a simple bunch of input data.

That's all!
